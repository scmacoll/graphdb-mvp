Creating a structured Roam notes-style outline can help clarify the project's scope and goals. Here's an outline for building the MVP of your graph database using GoLang:

- **Graph Database MVP**
    - **Objective**
        - Develop a minimal viable product of a modern third-generation graph database.
        - Focus on simplicity while incorporating essential features without the flaws of earlier generations.
    - **Features**
        - **Basic Graph Structure**
            - Nodes and edges with properties
                - **Why?** Fundamental elements of any graph database, enabling the representation of entities and relationships.
        - **CRUD Operations**
            - Create, read, update, delete functionality for nodes and edges.
                - **Why?** Core functions necessary for any database to be usable in real-world applications.
        - **Simple Query Capability**
            - Basic querying of nodes and edges based on properties.
                - **Why?** Allows users to retrieve and manipulate data based on specific criteria, essential for even the most basic database functionality.
        - **In-memory Data Storage**
            - Store data in memory without persistence to disk.
                - **Why?** Simplifies initial development and focuses on the core functionalities without the overhead of managing file I/O.
    - **Implementation Details**
        - **Programming Language**: GoLang
            - **Why?** Efficient performance, strong concurrency support, and simplicity in handling data structures.
        - **Project Structure**
            - Organized into main application logic (`cmd`), database core functionalities (`pkg/db`), and graph components (`pkg/graph`).
                - **Why?** Helps in maintaining clean code separation and modularity.
        - **Indexing (Optional)**
            - Basic indexing on node and edge properties for faster query processing.
                - **Why?** Improves performance of queries, crucial for scalability.
    - **Future Considerations**
        - **Persistence to Disk**
            - Add capabilities to save and load the graph from disk.
                - **Why?** Necessary for real-world applications where data needs to be durable and not transient.
        - **Advanced Querying and Indexing**
            - Implement more complex queries and sophisticated indexing strategies.
                - **Why?** To enhance the database's performance and functionality as user requirements grow.
        - **Transaction Management**
            - Handle transactions to ensure data integrity and consistency.
                - **Why?** Critical for maintaining correctness in concurrent environments.
        - **API and User Interface**
            - Develop an API and potentially a user interface for easier interaction with the database.
                - **Why?** Enhances usability and accessibility for users not familiar with command-line operations.

This outline not only sets the groundwork for my development but also ensures each component and feature is justified and tied back to the overall objectives of my graph database project.
